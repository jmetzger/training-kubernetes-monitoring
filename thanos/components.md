# What are the components of thanos ? 

In a **Kubernetes context**, **Thanos** is typically deployed as a set of components (usually as Deployments, StatefulSets, and Services), each responsible for extending **Prometheus** to enable **long-term storage, high availability, and global querying**. Here's a breakdown of the **main Thanos components** and how they work **in Kubernetes**:

---

## Explanation

### üöÄ **1. Thanos Sidecar**
- **Runs alongside each Prometheus instance** as a sidecar container.
- **Functions**:
  - Uploads Prometheus TSDB blocks to object storage (e.g., S3, GCS, MinIO).
  - Serves the Prometheus data to Thanos Query.
- **Deployment**: Typically as a container inside the same **Pod** as Prometheus.

---

### üåê **2. Thanos Query**
- A **central query layer** that aggregates data from multiple Prometheus + Sidecar instances or other Thanos components (e.g., Store, Ruler).
- **Functions**:
  - Provides a single PromQL query interface across multiple Prometheus data sources.
  - Used by **Grafana** as the data source for querying global metrics.
- **Deployment**: Separate Deployment or StatefulSet with a Service.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **3. Thanos Store Gateway**
- Reads **historical data** directly from the object store (S3, GCS, etc.).
- **Functions**:
  - Makes historical data available to Thanos Query.
  - Doesn't collect or scrape; it's for **read-only** access to blocks in object storage.
- **Deployment**: Typically a separate Deployment, often with a PersistentVolume for caching.

---

### üì¶ **4. Thanos Compactor**
- Periodically **compacts, deduplicates, and downsamples** blocks in object storage.
- **Functions**:
  - Reduces storage costs and speeds up queries.
  - Only one active instance should run at a time to avoid conflicts.
- **Deployment**: CronJob or Deployment with single replica.

---

### üìè **5. Thanos Ruler**
- Equivalent to Prometheus's **ruler**, but works across **Thanos data sources**.
- **Functions**:
  - Runs alerting and recording rules on **global data**.
  - Can write rule results to object storage or remote write targets.
- **Deployment**: Standalone component, often with object storage access.

---

### üîç **6. Thanos Bucket Web (optional)**
- UI to **inspect the contents of the object storage bucket** used by Thanos.
- **Functions**:
  - Helps debug or verify the TSDB blocks and compaction.
- **Deployment**: Optional Deployment or sidecar for inspection.

---

### üîß Bonus: Common Setup Practices in Kubernetes
- **Object Storage**: S3 / GCS / MinIO is needed for Sidecar, Store, Compactor, Ruler.
- **Service Discovery**: Thanos components use gRPC and DNS-based discovery (Kubernetes Services).
- **Monitoring**: Often monitored by a separate Prometheus instance.
- **HA**: Thanos Query and Store components can be scaled horizontally for HA.
